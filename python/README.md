# Python

I am learning Python utilizing [docs.python.org](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial). I will keep some thoughts and notes that may be useful here.

To me it is very similar to what I've seen of F# and a little bit like Javascript in the sense that it is a high-level language.

## Useful Things

### Exponents

You can easily do exponents using the `**` operator

```razor
>>> 3 ** 2
9
```

### Strings

Strings can be concatonated without using a plus sign

```razor
>>> 'here' 'i' "go"
hereigo
```

The `print` function automatically adds a space between each item when using concatenation

```razor
>>> print('here' 'i' 'go')
here i go
```
