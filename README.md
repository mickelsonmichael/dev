# Notes - DEV

This is a fork of my personal notebook (hosted privately on GitHub). My intent is to separate my programming notes from my personal notes that were previously intermingled in the single repository. This will allow me to share my programming notes freely without concern about sharing sensitive information **and** allow me to utilize tooling such as Jupyter Notebooks and more.
